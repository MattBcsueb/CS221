A. P.E.T.S INC

B. Our goal is to try to make our pets more safe and to make them as healthy as possible. We want to implement a chip into your pets to keep track of their health 
and their location will be tracked so you could never lose them again. Our idea comes from how our pets are like family and we will do anything to keep them safe. 
Just like the fitbit or fitness tracker, we want to keep track of the health of our pets. Our mission is to increase the lifespan of our pets so they can live as 
happily as they can. We want to make a subscription service where you could watch the health of your pets through an app on your phone. Our company's passion is 
for our pets, we just want to make sure pet owners feel the security that they will be able to keep them safe. A lot of pet owners have felt the pain of losing 
a pet and we want to make sure they could live as happily with their family.

C. We could spread awareness of our company by having this service at adoption centers as an add-on when getting your pet. We could also sell the chip at a loss 
and the subscription service is where we could make the profit. If we keep the customer happy, we are going to have long subscriptions with them. 

E. 
Our closest competitor is Tile. They launched in 2014 and had a lot of crowdfunding support to help them. In the mid 2010s phone companies were adapting 
Bluetooth technology and they took advantage of the new wave. They used System-on-chip to make production cheaper and utilize technologies on modern cell phones.

health of your pets such as vitals, liver function, and cardiac activity.
