A.(CORE VALUES) Our core values are safe, secure, friendly, and most of all caring. We want to be able to help people find their pets safely and easily monitor 
their health. We will keep all of our clients details private and make sure that only the owner has access their sensitive information.
We will use 2FA security to authenticate the user and make sure there is no unauthorized access to our users' accounts.
B.(MOTIVATION) We love pets and we know they are mansâ€™ best friend. They are there for you when you are 
feeling sad and they know just the right way to make you feel love and happy. We fear the most 
when they are lost and our lives feel upended when they are missing. Not knowing where they are is 
the most upseting feeling a person can experince. We hope you pets never get lost, but if the unthinkable happens PETS inc has got your 
back.
